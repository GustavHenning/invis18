## Exploration
I went looking for some cool data on World Value Survey and I found a
category of questions called "Confidence" which I thought was interesting.

I knew that I wanted to have at least these elements in my visualization:

1) World map
2) Slider for year
3) Some window to filter the data (since ill have categories)

I found a lot of categories on gapminder concerning employment rate
and I thought about the relationship between the two...

Are they related? How?

## Part 2

Now I needed to take a closer look at the data from WVS.
